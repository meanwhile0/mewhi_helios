There is no license. Presets are not copyrightable material. They are configuration files and are not a form of expression in themselves. These presets are provided as is, entirely for free, and I will not be doing anything to defend my rights to my work here. The creators of each shader used along with the ReShade project are more deserving of your support than I am. That being said, if you paid for these presets anywhere, you've been scammed, and whoever sold them to you is a dick.
