A series of ReShade presets for FFXIV, vaguely inspired by the Helios-44m 58mm f/2 camera lens.

## Requirements
The shaders used by this preset are ones previously included by GShade. When I will have time, I will locate the source of each individual shader, but until then it is highly advised you use these presets with a migrated `gshade-shaders` folder.

**These presets also use Pascal Gilcher's RTGI, Solaris and ReGrade shaders.** These shaders are currently not available for free. [Here is a link to their Patreon so you can attain these shaders yourself.](https://www.patreon.com/mcflypg/) I won't be making alternatives that don't use these.

## License
There is no license. Presets are not copyrightable material. They are configuration files and are not a form of expression in themselves. These presets are provided as is, entirely for free, and I will not be doing anything to defend my rights to my work here. The creators of each shader used along with the ReShade project are more deserving of your support than I am. That being said, if you paid for these presets anywhere, you've been scammed, and whoever sold them to you is a dick.
